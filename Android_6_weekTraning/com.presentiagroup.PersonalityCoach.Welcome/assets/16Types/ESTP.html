<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;line-height:normal;text-autospace:none'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>Extraverted
- Sensing - Thinking - Perceiving</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
classic ESTP slogan may be “When all else fails, read the directions.” This
heavily action-oriented type, more than any other type, lives for the moment.
If reading the directions delays “the moment,” it may therefore be a waste of
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
ESTP is the ultimate realist with the lowest tolerance for unrelated theory.
The ESTP’s focus is directed toward people and things (Extraversion), and
information gathering is grounded in what’s real according to the five senses
(Sensing). The information then is assessed objectively and analytically
(Thinking) at the same time that the ESTP remains spontaneous, flexible, and
open to any new alternative (Perceiving). These four preferences
combine&nbsp;for quick, exact, tactile, objective, externally expressed
responses to any situation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
ESTP believes that time spent&nbsp; making plans and getting ready may mean
missing what is going on right now. So, for example, going to school makes
sense only as long as what’s taught is relevant and immediately usable. But the
ESTP would rather plunge into the “real world” and deal with real (as opposed
to textbook) problems using one’s innate talents instead of what one learns in
books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#065AB3'>At Work</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Entertaining and gregarious, with a short attention span, the ESTP
can often be found on center stage. The ESTP’s quick repartee, with a special
knack for practical jokes, makes them fun to be with. People are easily drawn
to and engaged by an ESTP. Their capacity to tackle and complete tough jobs,
their fearlessness in trying anything at least once, and their keen sense of
competition, make ESTPs doers, problem-solvers, and people upon whom one can
count when an exciting challenge lies ahead. Not that the job will be done
according to the rules. That’s part of the pride and cleverness of the ESTP. If
the job becomes routine, the ESTP will lose interest and become bored, causing
him or her to want to move on or change the setting. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>One ongoing dilemma for this type is that they are often oblivious
to established norms and procedures. As a result, they can be in continual
trouble with those in authority. Some other types are specifically
anti-authority and enjoy testing its legitimacy—not the ESTP. This type is
simply oblivious to authority. Looking at a job or problem, he or she begins to
see a way to complete or solve the dilemma and leaps right in, not having
checked first as to whether there are established procedures for doing
something. As a result, what may have been intended as a good deed by the ESTP
may be seen as something completely different by others, who may end up dubbing
the ESTP a “troublemaker” or similar term. The well-meaning ESTP ends up not a
hero but a failure. Fortunately for them, ESTPs are not given to much
self-punishment and simply move on to other endeavors.</span></p>

color:#065AB3'>In Relationships</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Exciting,
thrilling, and risk-taking. They live in the present, driven by the philosophy
that &quot;what is&quot; is always better than &quot;what could be.&quot; It's
a waste of time to cry over spilled milk, because the milk can't be recovered
and the crying can get in the way of managing oneself. They try to make the
most of every moment in a relationship, with the assumption that everything
will fall into place. If it doesn't, it wasn't meant to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>This
is a very sensual event for ESTPs -- touching, seeing, smelling, tasting, and
hearing. It is best when all the senses are stimulated and there is ample time
for expression, affirmation, and conversation about all that is happening. The
act is most satisfying when the ESTP can make the most of the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

normal;text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#065AB3'>Parenting</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Every
day, parenting begins anew. Each moment of parenting is an experience in which
the ESTP teaches and is taught -- they grow with their kids, and help them
grow. As with the rest of life, parenthood is an adventure into which the ESTP
enters -- and often leaves -- with more questions than answers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

normal;text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#065AB3'>Conflict</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Much
like the common cold, conflict is a fact of life that can't be cured. Resolving
conflicts requires about the same amount of time and energy as it takes to
ignore them, and the ESTP is equally capable of doing either. When they do
confront conflict, they tend to see it as a stepping stone in the process of
moving through life.</span></p>
