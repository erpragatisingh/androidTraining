may best be described as reserved, aloof, and interpersonally cautious, yet
ready to try almost anything once. They focus inward (Introversion) and when that
tendency is coupled with their objective decision-making preference (Thinking),
it is natural that they should be more inclined to wait and see where
conversations may go or what others might do before tipping their own hands.
Their view of the world is very concrete (Sensing) and that in combination with
the open-ended way in which they relate to the outside world (Perceiving), can
result in their taking a more active, spontaneous role than their apparently
detached nature would seem to warrant. They may, for example, be prone to
unexpected bursts of humor, a take-charge attitude, or a sudden drive to fix
whatever’s broken. Such displays of involvement often confuse others, keeping
them off guard—which is exactly the way the ISTP feels most comfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>ISTPs
are especially skilled with their hands and often get satisfaction from
accomplishments that are both tactile and immediate. When something—as opposed
to someone—needs attention, the ISTP’s powers of observation (related to both
their Sensing and Perceiving preferences) make it possible for them to plunge
into the task at hand without feeling it necessary to follow procedures or read
directions. This is how the ISTP prefers to work, and when the result is
success, the ISTP feels a wonderful sense of accomplishment. If, midway into a
project, the need for directions becomes apparent, the ISTP will refer only to
sections that are directly relevant, so that no time or energy is wasted—a
matter of great consequence to ISTPs. The ISTPs’ area of interest will take
precedence over assigned tasks that are perceived as dull, boring, or not
practical. They can become so engrossed with their own projects that other
obligations, if not abandoned outright or forgotten, take second place. In
situations that excite them, they work with great accuracy and precision, often
to the amazement and envy of others. They thrive on and prefer “working on the
edge,” even putting themselves at risk, if that’s what it takes to get the job
done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>ISTPs
can be seen as the original Jacks and Janes of all trades. They are good at
trying almost anything at least once; that's also the way they approach
meaningful relationships. When a relationship is working, ISTPs will keep it
going; when it is not working, they will fix it -- or get out of it. They can
become so engrossed in fixing or negotiating a relationship that they may
occasionally mess things up just so they can fix them again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

ISTPs live in the moment, intimacy is meaningful and satisfying -- as long as
it lasts. Experiencing it through the five senses is what intimacy is all
about. Talking about it will not make it better, and it could even ruin a good
situation if someone says something he or she later regrets.</span></p>

parents do not believe in planning. They tend to wait and see what each day
brings, and then do what is needed at the time. ISTPs, in their general living
and certainly in parenting, know that the best-laid plans go awry. Given that,
the plan is not to have a plan, and expect that things will work out for the
best as a result. Above all, they strive not to get excited, become emotional,
or lose their cool, for good reason: It takes extra energy which, if expended,
could make them less than ready for whatever will happen next.</span></p>

are not ones to start conflicts, but neither are they likely to shy away from
them. Because actions speak louder than words, they prefer not to waste time
talking. And they resist starting anything, especially a conflict, unless they
think it can be resolved. They get excited about negotiations, resolutions, and
turning a difficult situation into something constructive.</span></p>
