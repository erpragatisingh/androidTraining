<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;line-height:normal;text-autospace:none'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>Introverted
- Sensing - Feeling - Judging</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>ISFJs
like to work behind the scenes. Quick, easygoing, neat, orderly, and given to a
higher sense of duty and obedience, they find their source of energy within
(Introversion) and their reality in those things they can see, hear, feel,
taste, and smell (Sensing). That energy is focused outwardly in the service of
others (Feeling), always in an orderly and timely fashion (Judging). As a
result, ISFJs find meaning in life by serving human needs and making others
happy. Unless you’ve experienced this type, it’s hard to believe that someone
can be so dedicated and dutiful in so many aspects of his or her life. It is
amazing how nobly they work behind the scenes, allowing many great things to
happen and glory to be afforded to others. This is a direct result of the
ISFJ’s stringent personal sacrifice and their dependability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#065AB3'>At Work</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Who
would not want an ISFJ in the workplace? The qualities of being organized,
pleasant and a dependable team player is a manager’s dream. One only needs to
be around an ISFJ for a short while to realize how pleasant and quietly
gracious they are. The quiet support and affirmation generally associated with
ISFJs is a powerful asset in the workplace. It is a gift to be able to affirm
others---at work or wherever---ahead of oneself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Another
strength of the ISFJ is their tolerance for detail and routine. They are
motivated by established ways of accomplishing something and will work best
when one expects them to do things “by the book”. Likewise, when an ISFJ is in
charge, he or she will expect subordinates to work within established rituals.
If you follow the rules, says the ISFJ, you’ll get it done and you’ll reap
rewards. If you break the rules, you’ll be punished for the resulting failures.
For the ISFJ, this is a system that works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#065AB3'>In Relationships</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>They
are the embodiment of home and hearth. Duty to mate and children precedes all
other actions. ISFJs have a phenomenal capacity to tolerate the needs of everyone
else around them before they bother to take care of themselves. The danger is
that others are likely to take advantage of their generosity and dependability;
they can become the family doormat. But they are dependable nonetheless, making
them a stabilizing factor in a relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

normal;text-autospace:none'><b><u><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#065AB3'>Intimacy</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Their
intimacy is more an act of duty than a free open expression of love. However,
it is through such duty that a relationship can deepen and grow, thereby making
intimacy itself more satisfying and meaningful. ISFJs see intimacy as an
opportunity to say &quot;I love you&quot; in a very physical and tangible way.
It is the ISFJ who is most likely to say, &quot;I have never refused
him/her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>It
is a responsibility and a duty. The ISFJs' mission is to impose obligations and
appropriateness so that children grow into wise and responsible adults.</span></p>

color:#065AB3'>Conflict</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As with other
Feelers, conflict can be difficult. They likely must be pushed to the limit
before they will bother to openly disagree. When they do, it can be like a dam
that has burst. They may unleash a pent-up laundry list of faults, slights, and
wrong-doings. Though they may feel guilty after such an outburst, they will
likely view it as a purging and refreshing experience.</span></p>
