normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Perhaps
no type is more driven by a sense of responsibility and “bottom-line” behavior
than Introverted-Sensing- Thinking-Judging types. In the name of responsibility,
these Introverts have acquired social grace, ease with words, and all of the
appropriate interpersonal skills demanded at any given moment. They can be so
outgoing under clearly defined circumstances that they are sometimes mistaken
for Extraverts. But make no mistake: as the most private of the sixteen types,
these Introverts can don Extraverted clothing when the occasion warrants it
without changing their essentially Introverted inner nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
ISTJ’s highly responsible nature is shaped by the Sensing preference of the
information-gathering function. In other words, ISTJs focus inwardly,
concentrating on data that are objective, immediate, concrete, and pragmatic.
Their affinity for the here and now leaves them to assume nothing, to take
nothing for granted. What they see they translate objectively and tangibly (T),
which they immediately organize and schedule (J). Since this comes easily and
naturally to them, they expect similar behavior of virtually everyone else.
They are extremely demanding at home and work, even at play, engaging at times
in very compulsive behavior. To some observers, these seem to be your classic
Type A personalities—driven, impatient, and obsessive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>This
is the quintessential dependable, responsible type---hence, the quintessential
manager. Just like the work world itself, ISTJs are driven by accountability,
productivity and the bottom line. It is a natural and often happy fit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Responsibility
is their driving force, and after God, they are most responsible to their mate,
children, parents, in-laws, and friends, in that order. Fun -- like work, sex,
money, and everything else -- is usually a part of their to-do list. If a
successful relationship is not on the list, it simply won't happen. If it is,
you can count on them to work hard to achieve that goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>ISTJ
is a no-frills, work-hard, play-hard type. They are seen as compulsive,
hard-charging, capable, and true to their word. They live by the bottom line
and can be very cost-conscious. They can be slow to change but once they see
the practical value in making a course correction, they can be quick to
implement it and often become zealots of the new way of thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Among
the many strengths of the ISTJ is the ability to act quickly and, very often,
correctly. They have a propensity for beginning projects and staying with them
through completion. This drive is aided and abetted by their dogged
determination for covering all details and staying specific. It is the ISTJ who
has given the workplace so many of the &quot;scripts&quot; by which we operate:
&quot;An idle mind is the devil's playground.&quot; &quot;Waste not, want
not.&quot; &quot;Hard work never hurt anybody.&quot; &quot;Anything worth doing
is worth doing well.&quot; &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned.&quot;
Clearly, ISTJs work to live and live to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>They
are slow to express their feelings and while their intimacies may run very,
very deep, little of that depth is likely to be shared. Physical intimacy will
be scheduled with attention paid to gender appropriateness: who initiates it,
who's aggressive, who assumes the dominant role, and who's on top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>For
ISTJs, parenting is a lifelong responsibility that is undertaken seriously.
They impose rules and regulations upon their children—and sometimes on their
spouses and expect them to be followed and not questioned. After all, when the
ISTJ was a child, things were done in this way; now that they themselves are in
authority, they expect things “should” continue to be done as they were before.
Roles, for the ISTJ parent, are clearly defined: parents are parents, children
are children, and each has appropriate responsibilities. It is not uncommon for
an ISTJ to assign family duties for a whole weekend so that no time is wasted.
To the ISTJ, an idle mind is the devil’s playground and “honest work” is good
for all. Even relaxation is scheduled and dutifully executed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In general,
they don't believe in the concept. The only conflict is when someone disagrees
with their point of view, which they assume to be correct. Therefore, conflict
resolution can become an exercise in converting the other person over to their
point of view.</span></p>
