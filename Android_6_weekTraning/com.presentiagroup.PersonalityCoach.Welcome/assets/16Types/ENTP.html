<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>ENTPs
are highly inventive types whose enthusiasms lead them into a variety of
activities, vocational and avocational. Their inventiveness is attributed to their
rich iNtuition (N), which gives them a world of endless possibilities, which,
when combined with their objective decision-making facility (T) and directed
outwardly (E), converts everything to ideas and schemes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Like
most Extraverted-Perceivers, they are more excited about pursuing a new idea
than about following through on an existing one, which can be a cause for
frustration and anxiety—both for themselves and for those around them. To the
ENTP, all the world is a chessboard whose pieces must be moved in such a way—by
the ENTP— that all the players will get the best and the most out of life.
Constantly bombarding themselves and others with ideas, ENTPs burst with an
excitement that, at best, leads to tackling one exciting challenge after
another and, at worst, leads to an endless series of delayed or unfulfilled
dreams. The ENTP is a “big picture” person who finds it challenging to see how
many ways there are for fitting the various pieces of the whole together. In
fact, it is their ability to see the big picture that enables them to generate
so many creative alternatives for just about any system whether that “system”
is a family, a vacation, a record collection, or a major corporation. They know
that any system, no matter how successful, can always be made better or more
effective. Such perceptions can at times make them seem almost psychic about
future developments in a variety of disciplines. Clearly, these qualities make
them well suited for a variety of entrepreneurial adventures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>When
there's an ENTP on the job, one truly does not know what to expect next. It
seems like every moment can be up for grabs when this generally high-energy,
dynamic, creative, resilient, argumentative type is around. They are the
embodiment of, &quot;If at first you don't succeed, drop it or try something
else.&quot; Upbeat, maybe even tiring to different types, ENTPs are the perfect
punsters. They would much rather engage in intellectual banter than complete
some meaningless task or be quiet by themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
ENTP tends to see the workplace---indeed the entire world---as one large board
upon which the daily game of life is played. The game is never over. There are
some wins and losses, but mostly it is one exciting challenge after another.
The important thing is the challenge, not the outcome. &quot;Did you learn
something in the process?&quot; &quot;Is the workplace better off because of
the process?&quot; &quot;How ready are you to take on tomorrow because of what
you learned today?&quot; These are semi-rhetorical questions that underlie most
of the ENTP's energy for daily work.</span></p>

are the idea people, constantly improving and innovating ways in which
relationships can grow and mature. This happens not just daily, but hourly.
There are new ways to grow, worlds to conquer, and things to do that will
produce growth, excitement, and self-improvement. The danger is that their
enthusiasm isn't always backed up with action.</span></p>

is an opportunity to challenge, encourage, and improve young minds. Children,
for ENTPs, can be an excuse not only to teach, but to learn themselves. They
can turn any chore, event, or family matter into an exercise in self-mastery
for both their children, their spouse, and themselves. Their goal is to make
everyone independent thinkers, regardless of whether this is appropriate for
each individual.</span></p>

normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>What
is perceived by ENTPs as a simple exchange of clever words or ideas can be
viewed by others as a fight provoking comment. But ENTPs aren't necessarily
committed to what they've said; it's merely a matter of getting all the words
and points of view out on the table, where they can be confronted. For them,
what's important is not to take things personally so much as work things
through in order to engender growth or learning. Their need for constant
improvement often results in wanting to get in the final word on a subject,
even though they know they risk dragging out a conflict.</span></p>
