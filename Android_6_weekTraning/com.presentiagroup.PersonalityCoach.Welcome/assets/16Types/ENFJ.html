of the ENFJ’s preferences compound to make them a natural convincer. Their
energy comes from their outwardly directed, socially-oriented, gregarious external
world (Extraversion). They prefer to perceive the world as having endless
possibilities and meanings (iNtuition), which they use to make subjective,
interpersonally based decisions (Feeling). They prefer to live their daily
lives in a structured, scheduled, and orderly fashion (Judging). These
preferences all together make a highly enthusiastic and interpersonally adept
type that seem always to be selling, networking and emoting.</span></p>

people. Their focus and direction is toward other people (Extraversion), and
they are highly skilled in understanding others’ needs and motivations
(Feeling). These tendencies, along with their gift for imagination and inspiration
(iNtuition), are expressed in an organized, effective way that allows them to
make their imaginative ventures become reality. Hence, the ENFJ is a highly
credible leader who attracts many followers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

ENFJ has the capacity to size up a situation iNtuitively and, in a very caring
and concerned way, say just the right thing. This is part of why people are
drawn to ENFJs, and why ENFJs are such natural leaders. They are seldom at a
loss to iNtuit just what the group needs or how to help it reach its goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Because
of these group-leadership abilities, ENFJs, more than other Feeling types,
often rise to the top of a cross section of organizations. They are, indeed,
natural and often well-liked leaders. The ENFJ sees the entire world as filled
with people whose endless needs and concerns are waiting to be funneled into
organizations and institutions that can serve those human needs. ENFJs have a
zeal for imposing “what’s good for humanity” upon humanity—and, fortunately,
more often than not, humanity is better off as a result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>ENFJs
are relationship junkies. Generally skilled at interpersonal dynamics, they are
an inspiration to, and are inspired by, others. They do well motivating those
closest to them and generally are happiest when a mate responds to their
affirmations. The ENFJ also loves to rescue and take care of his or her mate
and children. Though such caretaking can at times be smothering, ENFJs are
generally appreciated for warmth and affection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As
with other areas of life, intimacy is a chance to express caring and concern,
so the mate's happiness and satisfaction is foremost in any intimate encounter.
Like other Feelers, part of the ENFJs' need is to meet others' needs. Intimacy
is a scheduled, affirming opportunity for sweet talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Parenting,
for the ENFJ, is a responsibility and a pleasure. There are young lives just
waiting to be molded by the ENFJ’s value system. Unlike most other types,
especially Perceivers, ENFJs don’t wait for a child to develop. Instead, right
and wrong, good and bad, and other models are imposed in a very warm,
supportive, and clearly defined environment. A child will know where an ENFJ
parent stands on most things, and how he or she is expected to behave. When
behavior is appropriate, affirmation abounds. Negative behavior, however, often
makes an ENFJ parent feel like a failure, which in turn can give the child who
picks up on these feelings a sense of guilt about failing to please mother or
father.</span></p>

color:#065AB3'>Conflict</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>This is
troublesome for ENFJs, something to be avoided. With such a positive approach
to people, they use a great deal of time and energy to keep venomous thoughts
and actions from surfacing in the hopes that they will simply go away. There is
no conflict so big that it cannot be swept under a rug with a few affirming
words.</span></p>
