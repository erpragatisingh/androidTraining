<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>INFJs
are gentle, compassionate, and accepting, yet given to streaks of extreme
stubbornness. The INFJs’ driving force is their iNtuition (N), which is directed
inward (I), generating a never-ending stream of possibilities and ideas. In
fact, the more the INFJ introverts, the more malleable and open-ended life can
seem. But the external world has a way of interfering with this flow of
inspirations and creativity because INFJs feel called upon to render service to
humanity (F) in a very orderly and demanding way (J).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Consequently,
when INFJs are committed to an ideal or cause, the stubbornness surfaces. These
otherwise compliant, reserved individuals become extremely rigid and demanding
of themselves and others, when pursuing a goal in the external world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>INFJs
are dreamers whose genius, caring, and concern can be an inspiration to
many&nbsp; other people. Their quietness gives them a low profile and their
concern has a way of being intense in most situations in which they find
themselves. In almost any interpersonal activity, from a board meeting to an
intimate family gathering, the INFJ’s quiet strength is felt by others. Their
hope, aspiration, and caring have limits, however, and those limits can be
invoked by the INFJ at any given moment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Wherever
scholarly dependability is needed in the workplace, there’s no better person to
turn to than an INFJ. A popular human-services-oriented type, most of their
energies are directed toward bettering a condition, especially the human one.
No one word does justice to the complexities of the human personality. However
the word gentle continues to come to mind when thinking of the INFJ. The INFJ’s
overall work style brings a good balance of schedule and accountability with an
awareness of others’ needs. INFJs are particularly reticent when it comes to
conflict and often know ahead of anyone else when it is about to erupt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>INFJs
strengths include their intellectual prowess, their personal idealism, and
their general caring and concern for humanity. The combination of their four
letters leads them to pursue the theoretical and accomplish most goals by which
academic achievement is measured. Few people fully appreciate the rich inner
life of the INFJ and how steeped it is in imaginative, creative, abstract ideas
and concepts. Such pursuit is its own reward, and to be allowed to do
that---and to encourage others to do the same---is what life is all about for
the INFJ. Consequently, any task or event will always be the richer if he or
she can first place it in some conceptual frame of reference that includes
thinking it through thoroughly. INFJ’s nonstop search for learning,
self-growth, and development---and wishing the same for everyone else---makes
them very reassuring to others and people worth emulating. Their keen insights
and generally strong character are an inspiration to all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Driven
by a rich imagination and a deep concern for others, they are a source of
unending inspiration and enjoyment to the people in their lives. Their inner
life is their driving power, and a possible weakness is their slowness to share
some of their inner richness. However, this is overcome by the sensitivity and
concern shown towards their mate and children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>This
is the confluence of heart, mind, and spirit. It is a giving of self in the
meeting of the mate, so that the two individuals become one entity. Intimacy,
for INFJs, represents the loss of self in favor of their lover's needs. Their
inner inspiration reaches its fullest potential in the overt acting out of
love, caring, and giving in such a physical and tangible way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Children
are the realization of much of the INFJ's purpose in life. After mate and God
comes parenting, as the ultimate value of a relationship. For them, it is an
expression of the deepest meaning of a person's movement through life. The same
inspiration that guides them is passed on to their children. As parents, INFJs
are remembered by their children as patient, good-willed, tender, and
inspirational.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
word, and all it stands for, is abhorrent to INFJs. Death itself is probably
faced more readily than anything that even resembles conflict. It is contrary
to their nature and they believe that nothing good can come from it. When they
must face conflict situations, they do so reluctantly and with a heavy heart.</span></p>
