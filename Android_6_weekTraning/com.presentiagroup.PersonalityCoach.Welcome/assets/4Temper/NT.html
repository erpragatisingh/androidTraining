<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>The NT Temperament</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>&quot;Change
for the sake of change produces learning, even if the only thing we learned is
that we shouldn't have changed.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>NTs
gather data consisting largely of abstractions and possibilities (iNtuition),
which they filter through their objective decision-making process
(Thinking).&nbsp; Their driving force, in their never-ending quest for
competence, is to theorize and intellectualize everything.&nbsp; Driven to try
to understand the universe, they ask &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;Why Not?&quot;
of everything: Why does this rule exist? Why can't we do it differently? NTs
are enthusiastic pursuers of adventures who, in their enthusiasm, may take
risks that unintentionally imperil other people close to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>NTs
-- who represent about 12 percent of the U.S. population --&nbsp; learn by
challenging any authority or source.&nbsp; They have their own standards and
benchmarks for what is &quot;competent,&quot; against which they measure
themselves and everybody else. Relentless in their pursuit of excellence, they
can be very critical of their own and others' shortcomings, and impatient when
confronted with them. They are frequently perceived by others -- often
incorrectly -- as being aloof, intellectual snobs.</span></p>
