<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS OF TYPEWATCHING</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>, like any good value system,
has its own Ten Commandments.&nbsp; These are guiding principles that can help
you use T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> most effectively.&nbsp; They
can also prevent you from using T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> recklessly, inappropriately,
and unethically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>1.&nbsp;Life tends to support
our preferences, making us even more distrustful of our non preferences.</span></b><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> </span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;Whatever your
type, you will find that the day’s events seem to take place according to your
preferences.&nbsp; So if you are a Judger, you will be glad at day’s end that
you had a structured plan, for it likely saved your hindquarters more than
once.&nbsp; And if you’re a Perceiver, you’ll sigh at day’s end that you were
able to hang loose and cope with the many surprises you encountered.&nbsp; This
will be true with each of the eight preferences.&nbsp; In a stressful situation
Thinkers will be glad their objectivity helped to keep them cool under fire
whereas in the same situation Feelers will be equally glad that they were able
to be supportive to the people who needed them, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>2.&nbsp;Your strength maximized
becomes a liability.</span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;
It is perfectly natural for us to rely on that part of us with which we feel
most comfortable.&nbsp; But by doing so, we can further neglect other parts of
ourselves, which eventually become uncomfortable, underdeveloped, and
unskilled. So, while Extraverts, for example, can bring excitement to any
situation, they can become poor listeners or can overpower others.&nbsp;
Introverts, on the other hand, have good listening skills and the power of
concentration, but when maximized these strengths can lead to isolation and
avoidance of controversial issues in the external world.&nbsp; Thinkers, for
their part, bring objectivity and rationality to any situation, but when these
qualities are maximized, they can lead Thinkers to disregard others likes and
dislikes.&nbsp; Feelers, meanwhile, bring subjectivity and people concerns to a
situation, but when these qualities are maximized, Feelers can over-personalize
and can carry grudges for years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>3. T<span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> is
only a theory; it takes real life to validate it.</span></b><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp; </span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Once you have a sense
of your type preferences - or those of others - it still must be validated
against actual behavior, experience, and self-awareness.&nbsp; For many
reasons, we often see ourselves or others differently from how we really
are.&nbsp; For example, if you are expected by others in your organization to
be objective, analytical, and organized, you may simply be adapting to the
environment.&nbsp; Or you may assume that someone will be outgoing and
assertive in a situation because you know him to be an Extravert.&nbsp; However
if, for whatever reasons, his behavior doesn’t match his preference, you have
either mistyped the person or there is some other extenuating circumstance that
is causing him to behave differently from his preferences.&nbsp; In any case,
it is essential to validate one’s observations with one’s experience before
leaping to conclusions or making false assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>4.&nbsp;T<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>
is only an explanation; it’s never an excuse.</span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp; There’s nothing more offensive
in T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>atching</span> than the neophyte’s readiness to excuse all bad
behaviors as the result of his or her personality preferences.&nbsp; For
example, “I meant to return your call, but I’m an Introvert, and we don’t
return phone calls.” or, “I meant to be on time today, but I’m a Perceiver, and
we’re always late.”&nbsp; Such excuse making may be acceptable in small doses
or in special circumstances, but in the day-to-day workplace, it’s an
unacceptable cop-out. Seasoned Typewatchers will use such occasions as the
basis for genuine negotiations about differences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>5.&nbsp;The whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.</span></b><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp; </span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>No doubt you’ve heard this before, but
nowhere is this more true than in T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>.&nbsp; This is both good news
and bad news.&nbsp; The good news is that the “parts” of T<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>
- the four pairs of preferences - make T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> easy to apply instantly.&nbsp;
You may not easily be able to distinguish whether someone is an ENTJ or ESTJ,
for example, but you may readily spot their Extraversion (their constant
thinking out loud), or even their preference for Extraverted-Judging (their
constant complaining about everything).&nbsp; On the other hand, the
complexities of putting all four preferences together are immense.&nbsp; The
ENTJ, to use the example above, is a big-picture person who wants to improve
the whole world; the ESTJ. In contrast, is a hands-on person who prefers to
establish an administrative procedure for the world’s good.&nbsp; So, two
people who look so similar can end up with severe disagreements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>6. TypeWatching is only one
lens through which to view human personality.</span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp; While facilitating, affirming,
and dramatically insightful, the four-letter descriptions of T<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>
are only door openers to understanding the people behind the letters.&nbsp;
Gender, ethnicity, values, socioeconomic factors, and many other things combine
to make us who we are.&nbsp; One of the dangers of T<span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> is
that there’s a tendency to take the four letters as gospel.&nbsp; That not only
violates some basic ideals of T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> but in the business world often
causes more harm than good.&nbsp; There’s nothing that can turn off any level
of employee more quickly than being put into a four-letter box as the sum and
substance of his or her humanity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>7.&nbsp;To be effective, TypeWatching
must begin with yourself before you can apply it to others.</span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp; The more you
know about yourself, the more you will be in a position to collaborate and
negotiate with those who are different.&nbsp; The process must begin with
self-understanding and self-awareness before it can become a frame of reference
for collaboration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>8.&nbsp;TypeWatching is easier
said (or thought about) than done.</span></b><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> </span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;We’ll admit that T<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>
can present some difficult challenges.&nbsp; There’s a natural tendency for
people to want to stick with what works.&nbsp; If your preference is always to
be in control, for example, it will likely be difficult for you to concede that
control to others, even when such an action might be in everybody’s best
interest.&nbsp; To make the most constructive use of differences involves
commitment, personal skill, and an underlying trust that the process will lead
to a better result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>9.&nbsp; Don’t blame everything
on your opposite type.</span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp; This is a natural thing to do.&nbsp; It’s easy to
believe that everyone who doesn’t agree with you is your typological
opposite.&nbsp; For one thing, some types naturally disagree or are prone to
arguing.&nbsp; That doesn’t necessarily mean they are against an idea; arguing
is sometimes a means of sorting things out.&nbsp; Moreover, some types need to
see a bottom line - where a discussion is leading, for example.&nbsp; In their
quest for direction, they may continually raise questions that sound like
disagreements.&nbsp; When something doesn’t go as expected, don’t leap to
assume that it was sabotaged by someone of another type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#065AB3'>10.&nbsp; TypeWatching can’t
solve everything.</span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;
Because T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span> is very positive and because it
explains many parts of everyday behavior, there is a tendency on the part of
enthusiasts to use it as an explanation for everything.&nbsp; Such a tendency
moves beyond T<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>ype</span>W<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>’s original intent and may add
meanings to behavior that cannot be explained by type.&nbsp; Sometimes, for
example, people have physical or psychological problems that are outside the
realm of “Normal” behavior.&nbsp; Some people have personalities that are so
complex - or so simple - as to defy simple analysis. T<span style='text-transform:
uppercase'>ype</span>W<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>atching</span>
doesn’t have all the answers.&nbsp; It is legitimate and even professional for
a Typewatcher to declare occasionally, “I can’t explain that,” or simply, “I
don’t know.”</span></p>
